 <!--
    Info about the demonstrators for WS2 and WS3:

    In the folders [/docs/cad/WS2](/docs/cad/WS2) and [/docs/cad/WS3](/docs/cad/WS3) you will find the printable files needed to build the demonstration models for workshop 2 and workshop 3. For workshop 3, you need to edit the parts rack and gear wheel because they are only available in STL print-ready format. Editing can be done in Prusa Slicer, which offers the possibility of minor modification.

    - Rack - one hole should be added, in order to screw the rack to the carriage on which the sensor is located, or possibly lengthen this element (details available: https://www.printables.com/de/model/522220-universal-gear-rack-collection-different-modules)
    - Make a hole in the element for the motor shaft (details available: https://www.printables.com/de/model/516177-universal-spur-gears-collection-module-15)

    General:
    - Maze solving description can be found here: https://www.instructables.com/Robot-Maze-Solver/
    - Replace pin of DigitalOut led1(PB_9); -> this is in conflict with the sensor bar resp. line follower
    - Create Workshop 6 with my dc motor
    - Document how to use PlatformIO
      - Especially with regards to gcc instead of armclang
      - Remove important note in sd card logger that it currently only works with platformio (if it works with latest mbed studio)
    - Document how to use Putty
    - In DCMotor.cpp PERFORM_GPA_MEAS and PERFORM_CHIRP_MEAS should be tested with the latest updates, here features like serial_pipe and serialStream could be introduced

Fast prototyping in robotics focuses on quickly building and testing a simple version of the system rather than aiming for perfection from the start. Through iterative development, each prototype helps identify and fix issues, leading to gradual improvements. This approach saves time and cost, encourages experimentation, and ensures that the final design is optimized based on real-world performance. Additionally, hardware and software evolve together, allowing adjustments to both as new challenges arise. Instead of spending too much time planning, build, test, and refine — learning from each iteration.

## Course Setup

In order to be able to complete the course, one must first register on the following platforms and obtain the appropriate tools. All the information needed to start the course can be found in [Course Setup](docs/markdown/course_setup.md).

This document covers all the information about: 

- [Accounts](docs/markdown/course_setup.md#accounts)
- [Software](docs/markdown/course_setup.md#software)
- [GitHub](docs/markdown/course_setup.md#github)
- [Arm Mbed](docs/markdown/course_setup.md#arm-mbed)
  
## Hardware

During the course, we will use the Nucleo-F446RE board from ST Microelectronics in combination with the PES board designed and developed at ZHAW. The basic hardware kit that students receive includes a variety of sensors and actuators for practical applications.

>**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
>
>- <b>When working with hardware (connecting, reconnecting etc.), it is recommended that all power sources are disconnected. This is a general safety measure! So for us, the Nucleo is disconnected and the PES board **Power Switch** is **OFF** whenever we change something at the hardware setup.</b>
>- <b>The USB cable should only be connected to the computer after the power switch has been switched on.</b>
>- <b>Do not connect the charger when the battery packs are not connected, otherwise the PES board will be damaged.</b>
>- <b>Using the PES board with power ON and hardware running while connected to your computer/laptop happens at your own risk. There was a case where a student's laptop was damaged in the past.</b>
>- <b>Various Nucleo boards, PES boards and even laptops have been damaged in the past, so make sure to stick to the rules above.</b>

### Nucleo F446RE

The Nucleo-F446RE is a microcontroller development board featuring the STM32F446RET6 microcontroller from ST Microelectronics. It provides a versatile platform for prototyping and developing embedded systems, offering a wide range of peripherals, connectivity options, and compatibility with the Arduino and ST Morpho ecosystems.

    <i>Nucleo F446RE Overview</i>
</p>

Arm Mbed provides a dedicated platform with essential information about the development board. Here you can find technical specifications and the pinmap.

- [Mbed ST-Nucleo-F446RE][0]

### PES Board

The PES board is a hardware board with additional sensors, devices and power electronics to work in combination with the Nucleo F446RE. It provides multiple pinouts for:

- 3 DC-Motor (brushed)
- 4 Servos (these occupy the 4 DI/O if used)
- 4 DI/O, 3.3V (5V tolerant)
- 4 AI/O, 3.3V (5V tolerant)
- 3 Encoder-Counter
- 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)
- SD-Card slot

>**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
>- <b>The voltage of the DO (servos) is set via the switch behind the charging socket: 3.3V or 5V. Generally this can be set to 5V.</b>
>- <b>Motor encoder soldering can be wrong. Do not assume that if you plug in one motor and everything works you can then also use the same connections with a different motor. You have to make sure that the physical rotation is according to your needs and that a positive input leads to a positive change of increments.</b>
>- <b>Depending on the PES board version DCMotor M3 rotation direction might be inverted.</b>
>- <b>Depending on the PES board version, the pin map might differ. Feel free to ask if you are not sure.</b>

#### Batteries

The kit includes two sets of 6V battery packs, which can be connected in series to provide 12 volts. The battery packs need to be connected to the back of the PES board. The picture below illustrates the proper battery connection required to get a total voltage of 12V.

<p align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/battery_packs.png" alt="Battery Packs" width="600"/> </br>
    <i>Battery Packs</i>
</p>

The batteries enable the board itself to be powered independently of the connection to the computer/laptop, eliminating the need for a connection via the Mini USB cable. The board continues to receive a stable 5V supply while offering the option to use up to 12V supply for the power electronics of the motors. To activate the external battery power, switch the slider on the PES board to the ON position.

<b>Single battery pack</b> - if you are using a single battery pack, the remaining pins need to be bridged. If only 6 V is used, this must be parameterized accordingly in the firmware when parameterizing classes of hardware.

#### Charging the Batteries

<b>Using the Charger</b> - if you connect the charger to the PES board, the battery packs must be connected. If the battery packs (2 packs for 12 volts or one pack and a jumper for 6 volts) are not connected when you plug in the charger, the PES board will be destroyed. <b>THE CHARGER IS NOT A POWER SUPPLY!</b>

<b>Charging batteries</b> - the battery packs are only charged when the power switch is set to OFF.

<b>Usage while charging</b> - don't use the PES board while it is charging.

#### Resources

All additional technical information such as schematics and pin maps for the PES board can be found [here](/docs/datasheets/pes_board_data). Also included there are CAD files of the combined Nucleo F446RE and PES board in `.3dxml` extensions (for 3Dexperience).

### Hardware Tutorials

The following links point to the hardware tutorials. These documents contain specifications and technical information about the hardware itself and how to use it. The tutorials cover the software drivers, specific calibration procedures, controlling actuators and retrieving measurements from the sensors and actuators.
